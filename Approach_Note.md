# BigMart Sales Prediction - Approach Note

## Problem Understanding
The goal was to build a predictive model for BigMart's item outlet sales. The challenge involved predicting sales for various products across different stores, considering multiple factors like item properties, outlet characteristics, and historical sales data.

## Data Analysis & Feature Engineering Approach

### 1. Initial Data Exploration
- Analyzed data distributions and relationships
- Identified missing values in Item_Weight and Outlet_Size
- Discovered inconsistencies in categorical variables
- Examined sales patterns across different categories

### 2. Feature Engineering Steps
- **Missing Value Treatment**:
  - Item_Weight: Filled using mean weight per Item_Type
  - Outlet_Size: Imputed based on Outlet_Type characteristics
- **Feature Transformations**:
  - Standardized Item_Fat_Content categories
  - Created Item_Type_Combined for broader categorization
  - Converted Outlet_Establishment_Year to Outlet_Age
  - Generated Price_Range based on Item_MRP quartiles

## Modeling Strategy

### 1. Base Models
Started with traditional models and gradually moved to advanced algorithms:
- Random Forest (RMSE: 1036.54)
- Gradient Boosting (RMSE: 1036.11)
- CatBoost (RMSE: 1025.52)
- LightGBM (RMSE: 1055.26)

### 2. Model Optimization
- Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Implemented cross-validation for robust evaluation
- Created ensemble models using weighted voting
- Handled negative predictions in final output

### 3. Final Solution
- Selected CatBoost as the best performing model
- Achieved RMSE of 1025.52 on validation set
- Ensured all predictions were non-negative
- Generated comprehensive documentation and analysis

## Key Learnings
1. Feature engineering significantly improved model performance
2. Ensemble methods didn't outperform the best single model
3. Handling negative predictions was crucial for business logic
4. Cross-validation helped in robust model selection

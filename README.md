# BigMart Sales Prediction

This project implements a machine learning solution to predict sales for BigMart stores using various regression models and ensemble techniques.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the sales of products in different BigMart stores based on various features like product characteristics, store details, and historical sales data.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Multiple model implementations (CatBoost, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting)
- Ensemble learning with weighted voting
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Comprehensive model evaluation

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required packages:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - catboost
  - lightgbm
  - xgboost

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tapas1990/Hackathon_BigMart_Sales.git
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main script:
```bash
python bigmart_sales_prediction_enhanced.py
```

## Results

The model results and performance metrics are saved in `model_results.md`.

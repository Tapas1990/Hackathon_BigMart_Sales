# Exploratory Data Analysis Summary

## Key Findings

1. **Missing Values**:
   - Item_Weight has missing values in both train and test sets
   - Outlet_Size has missing values that need to be handled

2. **Distribution Patterns**:
   - Item_MRP shows a multi-modal distribution
   - Item_Outlet_Sales is right-skewed
   - Item Types are not evenly distributed

3. **Sales Patterns**:
   - Strong correlation between Item_MRP and Sales
   - Different outlet types show distinct sales patterns
   - Outlet size impacts sales performance

4. **Categorical Variables**:
   - Item_Fat_Content has inconsistent labeling
   - Outlet_Type significantly influences sales
   - Establishment Year shows historical sales trends

## Visualization Improvements

1. `sales_distribution.png`: Added KDE curve for better distribution visualization
2. `sales_by_outlet_type.png`: Used violin plots for better distribution insight
3. `sales_by_item_type.png`: Added swarm plots to show data distribution
4. `mrp_vs_sales.png`: Added regression line to show trend
5. `sales_by_outlet_size.png`: Added 95% confidence intervals
6. `sales_by_location.png`: Used violin plots for distribution visualization
7. `visibility_vs_sales.png`: Used hexbin plot for better density visualization
8. `sales_by_fat_content.png`: Used violin plots for distribution insight
9. `correlation_matrix.png`: Improved styling with masked upper triangle

## Implications for Feature Engineering

1. Need to handle missing values in Item_Weight and Outlet_Size
2. Standardize Item_Fat_Content categories
3. Consider creating price range categories based on Item_MRP
4. Potential for outlet age feature from establishment year
5. Possibility of grouping similar item types
6. Consider log transformation for right-skewed sales data
7. Investigate zero-visibility items as potential data quality issue
